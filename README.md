# Rust Quantitative Analysis Library
I got bored and so I started implementing autograd features for rust including polynomial evaluation, error functions and normal distributions.
## Purpose
The goal is to implement multiple pricing models for various niche markets. This includes all forms of derivatives, options, futures, warrant bonds, convertibles, crypto derivatives, etc...
## Principles
- Interfaces should be simple.
- Models should be universal and interchangable.
- Performance is critical in the case of real time analysis.
- All pricing models should be extensible.
